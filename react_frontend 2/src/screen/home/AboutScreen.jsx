        For that reason My Green Mart considers the welfare of all those people who participate in the making of a food product. Starting with the farmers who stand at the beginning of the value chain, the employees who work for its suppliers and all the way to the My Green Mart staff that is responsible for the processing, packaging, storage and logistics of our food products.
    </p>
    <p>
        The underlying base for all this are fair and adequate prices that My Green Mart pays and that create adequate value at all levels. Frequent visits to its farmers and upstream suppliers – including those who are no HAND IN HAND partners – provide My Green Mart insights into local conditions and help to establish authentic social contacts.
