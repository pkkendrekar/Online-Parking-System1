        <h5>IntercityParking Services:</h5>
        <p>
          The services provided by IntercityParking are limited to informing our
          customers of the location and apparent availability of parking and
          providing customers the ability to pre-book parking (the “Services”).
          Despite the convenience of the Services, the decision to utilize the
          Services is solely yours and you assume the responsibility and any
          assumption of risk associated with the Services. The allocation of
          parking spaces within a lot is solely under the control of the lot
          attendant or uncontrolled if not attended. We, therefore, cannot be
          responsible for any consequences arising from the lack of suitable
          parking. In all cases, the parking arrangement will be governed by the
          agreement with the operator of the parking facility as posted at their
          location or provided to you by them.
